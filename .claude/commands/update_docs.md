1. Review the current project codebase for structural or functional changes.
2. Compare against existing documentation, starting with CLAUDE.md.
3. If undocumented functionality or patterns are detected:
   - Update CLAUDE.md with accurate, concise documentation.
   - Update any other relevant files (README, inline comments, etc.).
4. Ensure all changes are consistent, up-to-date, and minimally redundant.

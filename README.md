### Stock Management Flow
1. **Frontend Validation** - Real-time stock checks before adding to cart
2. **Stock Reservation** - Items temporarily reserved during checkout (30 min)
3. **Payment Processing** - Stripe handles secure payment collection with dynamic pricing
4. **Stock Deduction** - Successful payments trigger permanent stock reduction
5. **Cleanup** - Failed/expired sessions release reserved stock

### Dynamic Pricing Flow
1. **Price Management** - Team sets prices in Sanity CMS only
2. **Real-time Sync** - Checkout API fetches current prices from Sanity
3. **Customer Charged** - Stripe charges exactly what's displayed in frontend
4. **No Configuration** - No Stripe Price IDs or manual sync required

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main
4. **Initialize inventory system**: `POST /api/init-reserved-quantity` (run once after first deployment)

### Other Platforms
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm start`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Set up Stripe webhook endpoint
5. **Initialize inventory system**: `POST /api/init-reserved-quantity` (run once after deployment)

### Post-Deployment Setup
```bash
# 1. Initialize inventory system (one-time setup)
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/init-reserved-quantity

# 2. Verify system health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/inventory-health

# 3. Test stock validation
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/stock-status?productIds=halloween-tee,railcam
```

## Configuration

### Webhook Setup
1. In Stripe Dashboard, create webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe-webhook`
2. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`, `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
3. Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Sanity Configuration
1. Deploy Sanity Studio: `npm run studio:deploy`
2. Configure CORS in Sanity for your domain
3. Set up API tokens with appropriate permissions

## Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
The system includes comprehensive monitoring that automatically detects:
- ‚ùå **Negative stock quantities** (critical issues)
- ‚ùå **Reserved quantities exceeding total stock**
- ‚ùå **High reservation failure rates**
- ‚ùå **Suspicious reservation patterns during traffic spikes**

### Health Check Endpoints
```bash
# Quick system health check
GET /api/inventory-health

# Comprehensive monitoring report
GET /api/inventory-monitor?check=full-report

# Check for overselling issues only
GET /api/inventory-monitor?check=overselling

# Check for race condition patterns
GET /api/inventory-monitor?check=race-conditions
```

### Manual Monitoring
```bash
# Run comprehensive monitoring check
POST /api/inventory-monitor

# Trigger manual cleanup if needed
POST /api/inventory-health
```

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Active stock reservations vs total stock
- Expired reservations requiring cleanup
- Recent error frequency (per hour)
- Webhook processing success rate
- Products with stock inconsistencies
- Reservation pattern analysis
